# DA_Tone
Towards a genetic input model of baseline midbrain dopamine tone

## Background
This is a project I worked on over a year ago and set aside. I'm picking it back up. More to come.

## Make up of Tone
At he mammalian midbrain reward center, there is a group of dopmaine producing cells called the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) that connect via axons to the Nucleus Accumbens (NA). The NA is the site of dopamine receptors and itself projects to a feedback loop using one of the brain's opioid-like neurotransmitters (endorphin). 

The dopamine tone at the receptors of the NA is the result of 3 factors:
- Dopamine Release
- Dopamine Receptor number and function
- Time the dopmaine is allowed to be in contact with the receptors

They generally form the equation:
Tone ~ Release * Receptors * Time

So, anything that lowers release, lowers NA receptor number or function, and anything that lowers time for DA to be available at the receptors lowers dopmaine tone. Each of these three factors has genetic inputs.

### Release
GABAa, GABAb, Endorphin, Nicotine, DA2 autoreceptors, and 5HT receptors as well as Monoamine Oxygenase B (MAOb) all have a role in determining VTA DA release. Receptor mutations can be gain of funciton (GOF) or loss of function (LOF) and receptor function can be either pro or negative to release. This means that any particular mutation in any given receptor can't be predicted by its mere presence to do anything in particular to DA release. Each has to be considered on it's own. 

### Receptor Number and Function
NA DA2 receptors can have mutations which limit their number or function.

### Time
DA can be broken down in the synapse by Co-O-methyltransferase or removed by the DA reputake pump on the VTA cells (DAT). Any GOF of these proteins will decrease the time DA is available. Any LOF of these proteins will increase the time DA is available.
